IMPORTANT: Altering the colour ramp on the VCC Channel Viewer material is the only value in the scope of this add-on that cannot be altered from within the VCC Panel itself. If you alter other values within the material manually it is likely that the material will not behave as intended afterwards, in this event I'd recommend deleting the material from your blend data and re-loading your blend file, as this will give you the ability to re-import the material through the VCC Panel.

The colour ramp used for the VCC gradient feature is accessed through the material itself, as seen in the image below:
