Installation

IMPORTANT:
At this point you can configure the add-on by clicking the arrow next to the checkbox you clicked a moment ago.

The shortcut key to bring up the VCC panel in the 3D View can be changed here, but most importantly changing the "Preset Directory" to a custom location of your own choosing can be done here. By default your presets will be saved in a JSON file in the root directory of your Blender installation, this can be problematic when it comes to upgrading Blender as you may very easily forget where they were stored.

I also highly recommend backing up your preset file generally, but especially if you are upgrading or reinstalling VCC. The presets are saved when any changes are made to them (including editing, deleting, moving or favouriting etc), this process overwrites the entire preset file. The presets are only loaded when a Blend file is loaded, so if you were to update this add-on without re-opening your Blend file and then change a value in the presets you would lose your old presets. So to reiterate, when upgrading or re-installing CLOSE AND RE-OPEN YOUR BLEND FILE to make sure not to overwrite your preset file.
