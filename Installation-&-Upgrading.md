Installation

* Got to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install
* Select the .Zip file you downloaded
* Enable the add-on by clicking the checkbox next to "3D View: VCC"

IMPORTANT:
At this point you can configure the add-on by clicking the arrow next to the checkbox you clicked a moment ago.

The shortcut key to bring up the VCC panel in the 3D View can be changed here, but most importantly changing the "Preset Directory" to a custom location of your own choosing can be done here. By default your presets will be saved in a JSON file in the root directory of your Blender installation, this can be problematic when it comes to upgrading Blender as you may very easily forget where they were stored.
