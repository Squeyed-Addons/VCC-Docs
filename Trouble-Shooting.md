Can't see the vertex colours you've applied?

* In the "Object Data Properties" in "Vertex Colors" if there is more than one layer check that the correct layer has the camera icon highlighted to it's right, this set that layer as the "Active Render" layer.

Can't see your saved presets?

* Check the add-on preferences is set to the correct directory and that the saved JSON file has not had it's name changed from "VCC Presets.json".
* Close and re-open your current blend file, presets are checked for and loaded when a blend file is opened.
* If both sets of presets are empty and a new preset is added, this will also cause the add-on to check for exists presets.

Seeing "Warning: 1 x Draw window and swap: x.xxx ms, average: x.xxx ms" in your console?

* This is caused by the add-on as a forced re-draw of the blender window is required to perform various parts of this add-on's functionality. It doesn't cause any issues during the operation of this add-on.
