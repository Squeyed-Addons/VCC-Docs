The VCC add-on was designed primarily to allow easier access to more precise vertex colour controls and be able to work on multiple meshes at once, though it has grown since that initial idea and will continue to grow in future.

Features:
* Assign vertex colour values to single or multiple meshes at once.
* Control which channels (RGBA) to apply values to.
* Work with 0-1 strength values or full RGBA colours.
* Copy channel strength and colour values from vertices to be re-used.
* Includes a custom shader that allows the user to view individual colour channels (RGBA) in isolation or the RGB elements as normal, this shader is controlled directly through the VCC Panel.
* Save strength values and colour values to a list of presets, this list is independant from Blend files and can be accessed from any project.
* Bake colour gradients to selected vertex or faces in linear, spherical or normal direction forms.
