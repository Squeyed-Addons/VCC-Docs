# Accessing the VCC Panel

You can access the VCC panel from the 3D View in two ways:

* Using the VCC Key Binding ("alt + c" by default unless changed in the add-on preferences) while your mouse cursor is within the 3D View area

* Opening the N-Panel in the 3D-View (generally on the right of the 3D View) under the category "VCC"
